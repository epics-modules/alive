    <h1>alive Server Design</h1>

    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      The alive record in itself is not very useful, as it needs a
      server that collects the heartbeat UDP packets sent by the alive
      records on IOCs.  The server has to process the messages and
      keep a database in order to make use of the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typical intended configuration is for many IOCs sending
      heartbeats to a single server.  This of course means there is a
      single point of failure, being the server.  If this is a
      problem, since the record doesn't allow for multiple packet
      recipients (although it could in theory), multiple records could
      be on an IOC with different server targets (and different local
      TCP ports), allowing for server redundancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes how the data can be used.  It is based
      on how the author has designed a server.
    </p>

    <h1>2. Heartbeat Processing</h1>

    <p>
      The first thing is to make sure that the alive record is sending
      heartbeats UDP packets to the server
      (from <strong>RHOST</strong>) at the expected UDP port
      (from <strong>RPORT</strong>), and at the expected rate
      determined from the <strong>HPRD</strong> period.
    </p>
    <p>
      UDP packets will arrive at the server port from IOCs at this
      point.  UDP packets are by their nature unreliable, with some
      getting dropped or delayed (so packets may arrive out of order),
      so the packet handling has to allow for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IP address of the sending IOC is not included in the
      heartbeat.  This is because there might be several active
      network interfaces, which make it not clear which one will be
      used for sending.  When receiving the UDP packet, the IP address
      of the sender is given, which needs to be used for the IOC IP
      address.  The IP address alone can't identify an IOC, as
      multiple IOCs can exist on one machine, which is why
      the <em>IOC</em> environment variable is used for
      identification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following shows how the UDP message's fields can be used
      (they are shown in order), as well as the record field if one
      corresponds to that value.  A data structure for each IOC should
      be made, and all the data structures should be made into a
      searchable construct (binary tree/list/etc.) where the key is
      the IOC name.  Below, the values that should be recorded into a
      data structure are noted.
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <strong>Magic Number</strong> (32-bit) -
          <strong>HMAG</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This value is used by the server to weed out UDP packets
          sent to it that it does not expect or want.  A server
          typically would allow only one number, but at its discretion
          could handle multiple magic numbers (different ones for
          different IOCs) or just accept all packets.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Version of Protocol</strong> (16-bit)</dt>
        <dd>
          This value signifies the version of the message protocol,
          and determines the fields that follow.  A server can support
          multiple versions, or ignore all versions but one (forcing
          the IOC to match the version).  The current value
          is <strong>5</strong>.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Incarnation</strong> (32-bit)</dt>
        <dd>
          This value should be recorded, and it serves two purposes.
          It is the recorded EPICS time when the record was
          initialized, hence it's a boot time (as measured by the
          IOC).  It also acts as a unique identifier for the IOC
          session, and a change means that a boot happened and this is
          now a new session.  If this value changes, one should
          reinitialize the IOC's data record as if it was new (as
          things may have been changed between boots).
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Current Time</strong> (32-bit)</dt>
        <dd>
          This value should be recorded and is the current EPICS time
          as measured by the IOC.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>Heartbeat Value</strong> (32-bit) -
          <strong>VAL</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This value should be recorded.  It increases by one each
          time the remote alive record processes.  If a packet with a
          lower heartbeat value arrives, it should be ignored as it
          came out of order.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Period</strong> (16-bit)</dt>
        <dd>
          This value should be recorded and is the period used for
          sending heartbeats, which can be used for determining
          failure.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Flags</strong> (16-bit)</dt>
        <dd>
          This value holds bit flags for the server, and they need to
          be acted on.  Currently, the bits only deal with a TCP
          callback to the alive record.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Bit 0 (Read):</strong> Set
              when <strong>ITRIG</strong> is set, or when a record
              field is updated.  This means that the record wants the
              server to do a TCP callback to read its extra
              information.  After a successful read, this will be
              cleared. If the server does not want to implement TCP
              callbacks, then this bit can be ignored.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bit 1 (Blocked):</strong> Set
              when <strong>ISUP</strong> is set.  This means that the
              server can't make a callback to the alive record.  This
              bit overrides bit 0 (which operates independently).  If
              an attempt to make a TCP callback is made by the server,
              it will be rejected.  An IOC behind a firewall that does
              not allow TCP return traffic should have this
              permanently enabled to keep the server from endlessly
              trying to make a callback.
            </li>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>Return Port</strong> (16-bit) -
          <strong>IPORT</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is the port number to use for making a TCP callback to
          the alive record. If implementing callbacks, it should
          either be recorded or simply passed along to the callback
          routine. If the IOC was not able to create the callback
          port, a value of 0 will be here.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>User Message</strong> (32-bit) -
          <strong>MSG</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This value has no set action.  This value should either be
          recorded and/or acted on if used as a server flag.  Multiple
          values or flags could be combined in this value, and might
          need to be split out.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>IOC Name</strong> (variable length 8-bit)</dt>
        <dd>
          This value should be recorded as the searchable key for the
      IOC data structure. It's the value of the <em>IOC</em>
      environment variable at the server.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <hr>
      <h1>3. Failure Detection and Up/Down Times</h1>

    <p>
      When an IOC is turned off or crashes, there is no immediate
      detection of failure.  This determination depends on the rate of
      heartbeats and the number of missing heartbeats.  For
      a <strong>HPRD</strong> rate of 15 seconds, a failure declared
      after four missing heartbeats would be a minute.  This is fairly
      conservative, and if you are certain that the network between
      the IOCs and the server doesn't drop many packets, the packet
      number can be reduced; the <strong>HPRD</strong> rate could also
      be increased, although that means more processing at the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time value to use for determination of failure should be how
      long it has been since the last accepted heartbeat (as they can
      be out of order) was received, with the reception time being
      locally measured by the server, not the IOC's current time.
      There might seem to be some redundancy of measuring server local
      time when the IOC sends its local time, but this allows you to
      sense any packet delivery lag or any systematic difference in
      time (like from time zone differences).  One also has to
      remember that the EPICS time sent back from IOCs has a negative
      offset from Linux time of 631152000 seconds (20 years).
    </p>
    <p>
      A failure can be actively detected and acted on directly by the
      server, or the server can simply collect data and let polling
      clients determine the failures themselves (which allows for
      varying failure times and <strong>HPRD</strong> rates).
    </p>
    <p>
      The up time for an active IOC is the time since the last
      heartbeat plus the difference between the IOC's last current
      time and its incarnation time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The down time for a failed IOC is the time since the last
      heartbeat.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h1>4. Callback Processing</h1>

    <p>
      The TCP callback is used to get static information from the
      alive record.  If the IOC was not able to create the callback
      port, the value of the Return Port will be 0, and a callback
      can't be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server can make a callback at any time, although it
      typically should be done when a new incarnation is seen in the
      heartbeat message or when the Read (Bit 0) flag is set in the
      heartbeat message.  Also, if the Blocked (Bit 1) flag is set in
      the heartbeat message, the callback will not work as the record
      will not accept connections; if the server tries a callback to
      an alive record that is sending heartbeats to a different
      server, it will also fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information returned is static in nature (and the server
      doesn't really need it for running), so it should be recorded in
      a data structure, attached to the IOC data entry.
