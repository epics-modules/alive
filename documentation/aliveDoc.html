<h2>Record</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="aliveRecord.html">aliveRecord.html</a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>alive</b> record is used for determining where the
    heartbeat information is sent, as well as the extra environment
    variables that may be requested remotely.</dd>
  <dt><a href="aliveServer.html">aliveServer.html</a></dt>
  <dd>This describes how one can implement a server for receiving and
    processing the heartbeat meassages, as well as making inquiries to the
    alive record about the extra information.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>EPICS Database</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>alive.db</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This database is basically a straight implementation of the alive
      record itself.  It creates a record of the name "$(P)alive".

    <p>The name of the IOC sent back to the server is by default the value
      of the "IOC" environment variable, but the variable that is used can
      be changed by setting "$(NMVAR)" to a new value.
  
    <p>The <strong>RHOST</strong> is defined using "$(RHOST)".  The rest of
      the fields that can be specified have defaults in them that can be
      overridden.  The default for "$(RPORT)" is "5678", and for "$(HPRD)"
      is "15".  If multiple IOC are to run on the same computer, then
      "$(IPORT)" for each IOC should have a different value, or all
      "$(IPORT)" values should be set to zero to allow the system to
      determine it.  Only the first seven of the sixteen environment variable
      fields, "$(ENV1)" to "$(ENV16)", have defaults, being "ARCH", "TOP",
      "EPICS_BASE", "SUPPORT", "ENGINEER", "LOCATION", and "GROUP".
  </dd>
  <dt>aliveMSGCalc.db</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This database consists of a calcout record that will
      periodically set the <b>MSG</b> value of the IOC's alive record,
      based on status PV values of other <i>synApps</i> modules.
      The <b>MSG</b> usage is undefined, but was intended for sending
      warnings if something bad happens, as a sequence of error
      bits. Currently, only the status of the autosave is being used.
      If the first bit of the <b>MSG</b> is set, then autosave is dead.

    <p>This is not included directly in <i>alive.db</i> since the alive
      module might be deployed without the other <i>synApps</i> modules.
      It might also become locally customized.

    <p>There is an associated <i>aliveMSGCalc_local.req</i> file.  It
      does not use the normal <i>_settings.req</i> convention (which
      in recent synApps versions causes it to be automatically
      loaded), as it's intended for manually overriding the global
      defaults only if that is wanted.  Otherwise, changing the calculation
      parameters would need to be done for every IOC instead of at the
      master file location.

<h2>MEDM display files</h2>


<dl>
  <dt>aliveRecord.adl</dt>
  <dd><p>This is the medm ADL file for an alive record.  All the fields are
    exposed on this screen.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>How to build and use</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Edit <code>configure/RELEASE</code> to specify the paths to <b>EPICS
      base</b>.  There are no dependencies on any other modules.</li>
  <li>Run Gnu Make to build.</li>
  <li>Note that the <em>alive</em> module is not useful on its own, as it needs
    a remote server to send heartbeat information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checking to see if record works</h2>

<ul>

<li>Configure an alive record to talk to a remote server daemon that understands how to talk to this type of record.</li>
<li>Make sure that IPSTS gets set to "Operable", otherwise the
information port is not working.</li>
<li>Make sure that the HRTBT field is set to "On" (the default).</li>
<li>Make sure that the ISUP field is set to "Off" (the default).</li>
<li>Set ITRIG field to "Trigger".  If ITRIG goes back to being "Idle",
then the remote daemon has read the boot information, meaning the
record is successfully talking to the daemon.</li>
</ul>
