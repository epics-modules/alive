<h1 align="center">alive Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-1-0</h2>

<p>Added a field IOCNM which shows the IOC name that is sent to the
remote server.  If this value is set directly, then this is the value
used, otherwise it is found using the NMVAR field.</p>

<p>Added a field NMVAR to define the environment variable that defines
the IOC's name, with it defaulting to IOC.</p>


<h2 align="center">Release 1-0-1</h2>

<p>Changed number of ENVxx PV fields from 10 to 16.</p>

<p>Windows build fixes from other BCDA staff added.</p>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-0-0</h2>

<p>This is the first release of the synApps alive module.  It was
developed using EPICS base 3.14.12, but earlier 3.14 releases should
probably work.</p>
