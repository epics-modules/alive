<h1 align="center">alive Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Pending Changes</h2>

<p>
  Changed the name of the ENVxx fields to EVxx.
</p>
<p>
  Added 16 EVDxx fields, similar to EVxx fields, which are default
  environment variables that are unchangeable after boot.
</p>
  
<h2 align="center">Release 1-1-1</h2>

<p>
  Minor configuration file changes.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-1-0</h2>

<p>
  Added a field IOCNM which shows the IOC name that is sent to the
  remote server.  If this value is set directly, then this is the
  value used, otherwise it is found using the NMVAR field.
</p>
<p>
  Added a field NMVAR to define the environment variable that defines
  the IOC's name, with it defaulting to IOC.
</p>
<p>
  Added a new database, <i>aliveMSGCalc.db</i>, which creates a
  calcout that writes into alive record's <b>MSG</b> field
  automatically, based on available synApps error messages.
  Currently, it is only using an autosave error PV as input.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-0-1</h2>

<p>
  Changed number of ENVxx PV fields from 10 to 16.
</p>
<p>
  Windows build fixes from other BCDA staff added.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-0-0</h2>

<p>
  This is the first release of the synApps alive module.  It was
  developed using EPICS base 3.14.12, but earlier 3.14 releases should
  probably work.
