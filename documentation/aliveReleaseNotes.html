    <h1 align="center" style="margin-bottom:1.5em">alive Module Release Notes</h1>

    <h2 align="center">Release 1-4-0</h2>

    <p>
      Added <b>RRSTS</b> and <b>ARSTS</b> to show the read status of
      the main and auxiliary remote servers.  These can be used to
      help diagnose if there is a connection problem between the
      servers ans the record.
    </p>

    <p>
      Altered <b>ITRIG</b> field to work solely as a trigger and not
      imply a status change with its value.  It's value will
      immediately return to "Idle" after being set to "Trigger".
    </p>
    
    <h2 align="center">Release 1-3-1</h2>

    <p>
      Added mentions about the new github repository for the BCDA alive
      server, <a href="https://github.com/epics-alive-server/alived">alived</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 align="center">Release 1-3-0</h2>

    <p>
      Added <b>AHOST</b>, <b>APORT</b>, and <b>AADR</b> in order to
      allow duplicate heartbeats to be sent to an auxiliary server.
      This can be used for testing purposes or server backup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Made <b>RHOST</b>, <b>RPORT</b>, and <b>HMAG</b> all read-only
      to help make sure that record doesn't stop sending correct
      heartbeats to the server.
    </p>

    <p>
      Removed <b>NMVAR</b>, as it is redundant to simply using an
      environment variable to directly set <b>IOCNM</b>.
    </p>
    
    <h2 align="center">Release 1-2-1</h2>
    
    <p>
      Added <i>CONSOLE_INFO</i> as <b>EVDxx</b> default.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fixed compilation issue for non-gcc compilers.
    </p>
    
    <h2 align="center">Release 1-2-0</h2>

    <p>
      Allow <b>RHOST</b> to be a name, and not just a numeric IP
      address.  Added <b>RADDR</b> to contain the resulting IP address
      found, or state that the <b>RHOST</b> value is invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changed the name of the <b>ENVxx</b> fields to <b>EVxx</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Added 16 <b>EVDxx</b> fields, similar to <b>EVxx</b> fields,
      which are default environment variables that are unchangeable
      after boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved the default environment variables in <i>alive.db</i> from
      the renamed <b>ENVxx</b> fields to the new <b>EVDxx</b>
      fields. Added
      <i>STY</i> and <i>PROCSERV_INFO</i> as <b>EVDxx</b>
      defaults.
    </p>
  
    <h2 align="center">Release 1-1-1</h2>

    <p>
      Minor configuration file changes.
    </p>
    
    <h2 align="center">Release 1-1-0</h2>

    <p>
      Added a field <b>IOCNM</b> which shows the IOC name that is sent
      to the remote server.  If this value is set directly, then this
      is the value used, otherwise it is found using the <b>NMVAR</b>
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Added a field <b>NMVAR</b> to define the environment variable
      that defines the IOC's name, with it defaulting to IOC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Added a new database, <i>aliveMSGCalc.db</i>, which creates a
      calcout that writes into alive record's <b>MSG</b> field
      automatically, based on available synApps error messages.
      Currently, it is only using an autosave error PV as input.
    </p>

    <h2 align="center">Release 1-0-1</h2>

    <p>
      Changed number of ENVxx PV fields from 10 to 16.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows build fixes from other BCDA staff added.
    </p>

    <h2 align="center">Release 1-0-0</h2>

    <p>
      This is the first release of the synApps alive module.  It was
      developed using EPICS base 3.14.12, but earlier 3.14 releases
      should probably work.
    </p>
