<h1>alive - IOC Operational Status Record</h1>

<em>
Note: This record requires a separate program outside of the scope of
EPICS for it to be useful.  While code will be supplied with this module
for interacting with alive records, it is intended for it to be
straightforward to create a different implementation.
</em>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>
The alive record is intended as a way to allow verification that an
IOC is running.  It is an active system, using heartbeat messages sent
to a central server, which collects heartbeat messages and monitors
the IOC statuses.  The alive record also allows for the server to
query extra information of the IOC, being environment variables
(specified in the record) and system specific information (vxWorks
boot line, Linux user, etc.)
</p><p>
This system has several important consequences.  The server doesn't
need to know which IOCs to monitor, as they will self-report
themselves upon running a correctly configured alive record.  The
reading of the boot information also allows for real-time knowledge of
the IOC type and boot parameters.  The monitoring of IOCs is intended
to be outside of EPICS itself, so there is no needing to link EPICS
libraries.  EPICS network boundary issues with subnets are avoided, as
the heartbeat messages are sent as simple UDP packets and the extra
information is done with a TCP request from the remote server.
</p><p> 
This record could be extended to monitor real-time parameters (such as
memory use, etc.), but that is not what this record is intended for.
Once a system is known to be up, one should use typical EPICS methods
for these things (like devIocStats).  However, there is the 32-bit
<strong>MSG</strong> field ("Message Value" on the screen) which can
be used to send messages as defined by the user.
</p>

<p><hr>
<h1>2. Operation</h1>

<p>
The alive record does not process normally, as most of what it does is
done in two threads separate from normal record processing.  One
thread will send UDP heartbeats every <strong>HPRD</strong> seconds to
a remote server, while the other listens for connections from the
remote server.  When the record actually does process, the current
heartbeat that was last sent to the remote server is returned as
<strong>VAL</strong>.
</p><p> The default heartbeat period is 15 seconds, which allows for
declaring failure after a minute, if using four missing hearbeats as
the condition.  The heartbeating can be turned by setting 
<strong>HRTBT</strong> to "Off".
</p>

<p><hr>
<h1>3. Record Fields</h1>

<p>
The <strong>VAL</strong> field holds the current heartbeat value
(initially zero), and is incremented each time a UDP heartbeat is
sent, every <strong>HPRD</strong> seconds,
assuming <strong>HRTBT</strong> is set to "On".
</p><p> The heartbeat UDP packets are sent to a remote server using
the <strong>RHOST</strong> and <strong>RPORT</strong> fields to
specify address and port. The <strong>RHOST</strong> needs to be the
IPv4 numeric address, and not a name.
</p><p> The IOC's actual name as reported to the remote server
is contained in the <strong>IOCNM</strong> variable.  It can be directly
set at boot time; if it isn't then the name will be determined by the 
<strong>NMVAR</strong> variable, which defaults to "IOC" but
can be set to any environment variable.  The server may employ a magic
number to help filter out unwanted UDP packets sent to it, and this
number is specified in the <strong>HMAG</strong> field, and is the
first thing sent in the heartbeat message; the default corresponds to
0x12345678.  There is a 32-bit field that can be used to send a
user-defined message to the server, <strong>MSG</strong>, and its
usage is left up to the implementer.
</p><p> Unless suppressed, the remote server can attempt to read back
the environment variables and other information using the TCP port
specified by <strong>IPORT</strong>.  If initialized to 0, an
available port will be found and its value placed this field,
otherwise any nonzero value will be attempted.  If multiple IOCs are
on the same IP address, each alive record needs to use a unique port,
which is taken care of automatically if all are initialized to 0.  It
should be noted that <em>only</em> connections originating
from <strong>RHOST</strong> will be allowed to connect this way.  The
status of the port can be found with <strong>IPSTS</strong>, which has
three values set by the record: "Undetermined", which is the initial
value; "Operable", meaning that the port was successfully opened; and
"Inoperable", which means that there was a failure in opening the
port.  This field is to help debug use of the record.
</p><p> The send a trigger flag to the remote server, signaling that
it should reread the boot information, <strong>ITRIG</strong> should
be set to "Trigger".  When the variables have been read, it will
return to "Idle".  This is also a way to tell that the remote server
is working correctly, as going back to "Idle" means that the remote
server has done a read, therefore the communication between the record
and server works.
</p><p>If one wants to suppress the server reading the boot
information, <strong>ISUP</strong> should be set to "On"; the record
sends a suppress flag to the server, and will immediately close all
connection that occur.  This is useful if the IOC is behind a firewall
that won't allow a direct TCP connection, telling the server to not
endlessly try to read.
</p><p> Names of the environment variables to be sent to the remote
server upon request are <strong>ENV1</strong>-<strong>ENV16</strong>.
If the length of the value of a variable is over 65535, an empty
string will be sent back.
</p><p>The version of the record is kept in <strong>VER</strong>
as a string, in the form of "1-1-0".

<p><h1>4. Record Support Routines</h1>

<h3>init_record</h3>
<p> The current time is recorded as the IOC boot time. A UDP socket is
opened for sending heartbeat messages. An address structure for the
remote server is initialized, using <strong>RHOST</strong>
and <strong>RPORT</strong>. The name of the IOC is read from the "IOC"
environment variable.
</p><p> A thread is spawned for accepting TCP requests from the remote
server on port <strong>IPORT</strong>, and if the port value is
zero, the record will get an automatically assigned port, updating 
<strong>IPORT</strong> with the actual value.  The TCP port will only
accept requests from the IP address specified
in <strong>RHOST</strong>, and as long as <strong>ISUP</strong> is
Off.  The message sent back upon request is a list of the specified
environment variables, the IOC type, and the data special to that
type.
</p><p> If the <strong>HPRD</strong> is initially zero, then it is
reassigned to the default value, which is currently 15.

<h3>process</h3>

<p>
Nothing actually happens, other than the forward link get processed.
Heartbeats are controlled purely by a timed thread.
</p>

<h3>special</h3>

<p>
Changing the <strong>RHOST</strong> field causes a check here to make
sure that the string value is a properly formed IP address.  If not,
no sending heartbeats will occur.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>5. Message Protocol</h1>

This section describes the current protocol,
version <strong>5</strong>. All messages sent use network order (big-endian).

<h3>Heartbeat Message</h3>

<p>
This is the UDP message sent for each processing of the record.  The
minimum size for a message payload is 30 bytes, being being fixed
fields of 28 bytes with a null-terminated string.  All values are unsigned.
</p><p> 
The time values sent are EPICS time values, which are relative to 1990.
Converting them to standard Linux time values means adding a value of
631152000 (20 years of seconds) to each.

<h3>Information Request Message</h3>

<p>
This is the message that is read from the TCP
port <strong>IPORT</strong> on the IOC.  When the port is opened, the
IOC will write this message and then immediately close the port.
There is no way to write a message to the IOC this way.
</p><p> If the suppression <strong>ISUP</strong> field is set to "On",
the IOC will immediately close any connection whatsoever to this port
(ideally the socket would simply be closed, but that would make things
more complicated in the implementation).
